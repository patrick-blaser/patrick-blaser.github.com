Relevant parameters for OxyQuant calibration sediment cores:

| Parameter | Importance |
|:--------|:-----------------|
| pore water data available? | Pore water analyses such as dissolved O<sub>2</sub> are **very helpful**, but not required. |
| redox front known? | Knowledge about the depth of the redox front (zero O<sub>2</sub>) is currently **not essential**. However, if it is not known it must at least be *likely* that the redox front lies within the Holocene sediment layer. If the depth of the redox front is not yet established I will try to determine it with the help of the abundance of redox sensitive metals. |
| redox front in Holocene layer? | If the depth of the redox front is known it **must** be well within the Holocene layer. If it is not known, then it must at least be *likely* within the Holocene layer. |
| ancillary measurements? | Further existing or planned sediment analyses are **desirable**, but not essential. A sediment core **description is essential**, and a cruise report desirable. |
| specific BWO or productivity range? | At the moment I require sediment cores from **all ranges** of BWO and biological productivity, but particularly in the low BWO range. |
| other parameters? | At the moment I have **no constraints** on further sediment parameters such as sedimentology or sedimentation rates. However, a presence of *foraminifera* tests (both planktic and benthic) and *fish debris* is desirable. |
| sample size? | For the planned detailed investigations it is important that a certain amount of sediment is available from each site. Ideally, I would have one sample every 2-5 cm (maximum **10 - 15 samples**) per core. Each sample should ideally contain **10-20 cm³** of sediment, but 1-2 cm³ may already be enough for the more sample efficient investigations. |
