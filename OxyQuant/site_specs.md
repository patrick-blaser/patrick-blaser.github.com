Relevant parameters for OxyQuant calibration sediment cores:

| Parameter | Importance |
|:-------------:|:----------------|
| environmental setting | The sediment cores should be located in a ***pelagic*** environment, meaning open and deep marine conditions as far as possible. Settings on continental margins are acceptable as long as they are not located in restricted environments surrounded by continents. Water depths should be below at least 500 m, better even below 1000 meters. |
| pore water data available? | Pore water analyses such as dissolved O<sub>2</sub> are **very helpful**, but not required. |
| redox front known? | Knowledge about the depth of the redox front (zero O<sub>2</sub>) is currently **not essential**. However, if it is not known it must at least be *likely* that the redox front lies within the Holocene sediment layer. If the depth of the redox front is not yet established I will try to determine it with the help of the abundance of redox sensitive metals. |
| redox front in Holocene layer? | If the depth of the redox front is known it **must** be well within the Holocene layer. If it is not known, then it must at least be *likely* within the Holocene layer. |
| ancillary measurements? | Further existing or planned sediment analyses are **desirable**, but not essential. A sediment core **description is essential**, and a cruise report desirable. |
| specific BWO or productivity range? | At the moment I require sediment cores from **all ranges** of BWO and biological productivity, but particularly in the low BWO range. |
| other parameters? | At the moment I have **no constraints** on further sediment parameters such as sedimentology or sedimentation rates. However, a presence of *foraminifera* tests (both planktic and benthic) and *fish debris* is desirable. |
| sample size? | For the planned detailed investigations it is important that a certain amount of sediment is available from each site. Ideally, I would have one sample every 2-5 cm (maximum **10 - 15 samples**) per core. Each sample should ideally contain **10-20 cm³** of sediment, but 1-2 cm³ may already be enough for the more sample efficient investigations. |
**In summary**, the ideal sediment core would be, for example, a 50 cm long Multi or Kasten core from a location with intermediate bottom water oxygen concentrations, with available pore fluid O<sub>2</sub> concentrations falling to zero within the core, and with some age control showing that the whole core is of Holocene age.  

Other sediment cores are acceptable if they fulfil most of the above criteria.
