The suite of sediment core sites that will be used for the calibration of proxies for past Bottom Water Oxygen (BWO) is planned to contain 25 different sites. These sites should cover a wide range of environmental parameters, in particular in local BWO concentrations and biological productivity at the sea surface, which leads to a carbon flux into the underlying sediments and affects pore water oxygen.

     <b>(A)</b> Bottom water oxygen<b markdown="1">[^1]</b> is distributed unequally in the deep oceans. Fresh oxygen is mainly supplied by deep water formation in the North Atlantic and around Antarctica, connecting the deep ocean with the ocean surface. Similarly, the net primary productivity (NPP<b markdown="1">[^2]</b>) at the sea surface is widely variable. <b>(B)</b> Sediment core sites currently available for OxyQuant. I am going to use sediment cores from a variety of locations with very different combinations of local BWO concentrations and overlying primary productivity. For each of these cores, the general sedimentology and geochemistry is going to be determined, and then a series of parameters is going to be analysed and their suitability as proxies for local BWO assessed. Potential sites are shown as symbols. Existing qualitative (dashed) and quantitative (solid) proxies are indicated by their calibration ranges at the bottom of panel B. </i></figcaption>

I am currently searching for further suitable sediment cores. Please get in touch if you happen to know of any and want to collaborate!
