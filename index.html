<div class="main-explain-area jumbotron">
  <p>Welcome to my website. I am a climate scientist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. I try to improve our understanding of the climate system by analysing the connection between climate and ocean dynamics in the past. To this end I analyse geochemical data archived in ocean sediments, and connect the findings to environmental processes. With such techniques I contribute to deciphering the climates of the last ice age. This field of research is called <i>paleoclimatology</i> or <i>paleoceanography</i>. On this website I present the work I am involved with and updates on my current projects. </p>
