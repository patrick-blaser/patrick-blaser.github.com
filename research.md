I come from a physics education with interest in chemistry, and am 
now working in palaeoclimatology and marine isotope geochemistry – which
 helps me maintain a broad and comprehensive scientific approach. 
Combined with rigorous statistical analysis, method development, and 
modelling, it allows me to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of 
palaeoclimatological data and decreases the risk of bias, thus 
increasing our confidence and the significance of the interpretations. I
 also enjoy to supervise student theses, foster critical thinking, and 
teach classes.

My ongoing research topics include the investigation of:  
– Atlantic deep water mass distributions since the Last Glacial Maximum,  
– biological productivity, ocean circulation, and carbon storage in the Southern Ocean, and  
– deep sea sediments as sinks and sources of dissolved trace metals.
